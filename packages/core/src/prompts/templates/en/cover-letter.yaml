  VACANCY:
  {{vacancy.name}} at {{vacancy.company}}
  {{vacancy.description}}
  Required: {{vacancy.keySkills}}

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  !! USE THIS PERSONALIZED RESUME (not original CV) !!
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  PERSONALIZED TITLE: {{personalized.title}}
  PERSONALIZED SKILLS: {{personalized.keySkills}}
  PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCE:
  {{personalized.experienceFormatted}}

  CANDIDATE CONTACTS: {{contacts}}
  SALARY EXPECTATION: {{salaryExpectation}}

  AGGRESSIVENESS: {{aggressiveness}} (0.0-1.0)

  STEP 1: EXTRACT

  ```json
  {
    "extraction": {
      "top3_tech_from_vacancy": ["from {{vacancy.keySkills}}"],
      "top3_tech_from_personalized_resume": ["from {{personalized.keySkills}}"],
      "unique_role_detail": "specific non-generic detail about THIS role",
      "salary_required": true/false,
      "special_instructions": "any special requirements or null",
      "best_achievement_from_personalized": "pick the strongest bullet point with metrics from PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCE above"
    }
  }
  ```

  STEP 2: APPLY AGGRESSIVENESS TO CLAIMS

  Aggressiveness affects HOW BOLDLY you claim experience:

  0.0-0.3 (Conservative):
  - Use hedged language: "experience with", "familiar with", "worked with"
  - Only claim what's explicitly in personalized resume
  - Focus on transferable skills

  0.4-0.6 (Moderate):
  - Direct claims: "built", "developed", "implemented"
  - Claim all skills from personalized.keySkills confidently

  0.7-0.85 (Aggressive):
  - Strong ownership: "led", "architected", "owned"
  - Claim deep expertise in vacancy technologies
  - Add scale/impact language

  0.9-1.0 (Maximum):
  - Expert-level claims: "expert in", "specialized in", "deep expertise"
  - Present as ideal candidate for THIS specific role
  - Claim all vacancy requirements as core competencies

  STEP 3: GENERATE LETTER (3-4 sentences)

  Sentence 1: Hook using "unique_role_detail" — NOT company name, NOT job title
  Sentence 2-3: Use "best_achievement_from_personalized" + technologies from "top3_tech_from_personalized_resume"
  Sentence 4: Contacts + salary (if salary_required=true)

  CRITICAL:
  - Take achievements FROM PERSONALIZED EXPERIENCE ABOVE, not from your imagination
  - The personalized resume already contains rewritten bullets with required tech — USE THEM
  - Numbers and metrics in cover letter MUST come from personalized experience

  BANNED (instant fail):
  - "I am excited", "thrilled"
  - "your company"
  - "perfect fit", "ideal candidate"
  - Starting with job title or company name
  - Generic phrases like "I believe I would be a great asset"

  ```json
  {
    "extraction": { ... },
    "aggressiveness_applied": "description of tone used",
    "cover_letter": "3-4 sentences, plain text"
  }
  ```

  OUTPUT: JSON only.
