  TARGET VACANCY: {{vacancy.name}} at {{vacancy.company}}

  CANDIDATE'S KEY SKILLS: {{resume.keySkills}}

  TASK:
  Generate a professional resume title (max 50 characters) that:
  1. Reflects the candidate's expertise
  2. Aligns with the target vacancy
  3. Sounds professional, not generic
  4. Does NOT just copy the vacancy title

  GOOD EXAMPLES:
  - "Senior Backend Developer | Node.js & AWS"
  - "Full-Stack Engineer | React & Python"
  - "DevOps Specialist | Kubernetes Expert"

  BAD EXAMPLES:
  - "Looking for new opportunities" (too vague)
  - "Senior Software Engineer" (too generic)
  - "{{vacancy.name}}" (just copying)

  OUTPUT: Plain text title only, no quotes, no explanation.
